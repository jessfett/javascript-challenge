# javascript-challenge: UFO Sighting

### TASK: JavaScript-and-DOM-Manipulation
The task was to use D3 to manipulate the DOM and create a html based table that allows a user to input a date and sort through all recorded UFO sightings from the provided data.  In the javascript file, using D3, our javascript file was manipulated to create a new table based on the user input filter date.
